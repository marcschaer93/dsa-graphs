# **Graph Exercises**

Implement the following on the Graph class. The Node and Graph constructor has been provided for you in **_graph.js_**

## **addVertex / addVertices**

This function should add a node to the graph.

```jsx
let graph = new Graph();
let a = new Node("A");
let b = new Node("B");
let c = new Node("C");
graph.addVertices([a, b]);
graph.addVertex(c);
graph.nodes.has(a); // true
graph.nodes.has(b); // true
graph.nodes.has(c); // true
```

## **addEdge**

This function should add an edge between two nodes in the graph and place each value of the nodes in each array for the value of the node in the adjacency list.

```jsx
let graph = new Graph();
let a = new Node("A");
let b = new Node("B");
let c = new Node("C");
let d = new Node("D");
graph.addVertices([a, b, c, d]);
graph.addEdge(a, b);
graph.addEdge(a, c);
graph.addEdge(b, d);
graph.addEdge(c, d);

a.adjacent; // contains b and c
b.adjacent; // contains a and d
c.adjacent; // contains a and d
d.adjacent; // contains b and c
```

## **removeEdge**

This function should accept two nodes and remove the edge between them. It should modify the adjacency list to ensure that both values are not in each array for the two nodes which no longer contain the edge.

```jsx
let graph = new Graph();
let a = new Node("A");
let b = new Node("B");
let c = new Node("C");
let d = new Node("D");
graph.addVertices([a, b, c, d]);
graph.addEdge(a, b);
graph.addEdge(a, c);
graph.addEdge(b, d);
graph.addEdge(c, d);

graph.removeEdge(b, a);
graph.removeEdge(c, d);

a.adjacent; // does not contain b
b.adjacent; // does not contain a

c.adjacent; // does not contain d
d.adjacent; // does not contain c
```

## **removeVertex**

This function should remove the node in the array of nodes and also remove all edges that the removed node previously contained.

```jsx
let graph = new Graph();
let a = new Node("A");
let b = new Node("B");
let c = new Node("C");
let d = new Node("D");
graph.addVertices([a, b, c, d]);
graph.addEdge(a, b);
graph.addEdge(a, c);
graph.addEdge(b, d);
graph.addEdge(c, d);

graph.removeVertex(c);
graph.removeVertex(d);

graph.nodes.has(a); // true
graph.nodes.has(b); // true
graph.nodes.has(c); // false
graph.nodes.has(d); // false
```

## **depthFirstSearch**

This function should return an array of nodes visited using DFS. You can do this iteratively (using a stack) or recursively, but note the order of the results will be different. Try to solve this without consulting the lecture notes!

```jsx
let graph = new Graph();
let S = new Node("S");
let P = new Node("P");
let U = new Node("U");
let X = new Node("X");
let Q = new Node("Q");
let Y = new Node("Y");
let V = new Node("V");
let R = new Node("R");
let W = new Node("W");
let T = new Node("T");

graph.addVertices([S, P, U, X, Q, Y, V, R, W, T]);

graph.addEdge(S, P);
graph.addEdge(S, U);

graph.addEdge(P, X);
graph.addEdge(U, X);

graph.addEdge(P, Q);
graph.addEdge(U, V);

graph.addEdge(X, Q);
graph.addEdge(X, Y);
graph.addEdge(X, V);

graph.addEdge(Q, R);
graph.addEdge(Y, R);

graph.addEdge(Y, W);
graph.addEdge(V, W);

graph.addEdge(R, T);
graph.addEdge(W, T);

// this is one option:
graph.depthFirstSearch(S); // ["S", "P", "U", "X", "Q", "V", "Y", "R", "W", "T"]
```

## **breadthFirstSearch**

This function should return an array of vertices visited using BFS. Try to solve this without consulting the lecture notes!

```jsx
let graph = new Graph();
let S = new Node("S");
let P = new Node("P");
let U = new Node("U");
let X = new Node("X");
let Q = new Node("Q");
let Y = new Node("Y");
let V = new Node("V");
let R = new Node("R");
let W = new Node("W");
let T = new Node("T");

graph.addVertices([S, P, U, X, Q, Y, V, R, W, T]);

graph.addEdge(S, P);
graph.addEdge(S, U);

graph.addEdge(P, X);
graph.addEdge(U, X);

graph.addEdge(P, Q);
graph.addEdge(U, V);

graph.addEdge(X, Q);
graph.addEdge(X, Y);
graph.addEdge(X, V);

graph.addEdge(Q, R);
graph.addEdge(Y, R);

graph.addEdge(Y, W);
graph.addEdge(V, W);

graph.addEdge(R, T);
graph.addEdge(W, T);

// this is one option:
graph.depthFirstSearch(S); // ["S", "U", "V", "W", "T", "R", "Q", "Y", "X", "P"]
```
